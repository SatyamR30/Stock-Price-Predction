# Stock-Price-Predction

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project aimed at predicting the stock prices of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The project leverages historical stock price data and LSTM networks to make future price predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
```


## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Obtain historical Microsoft stock price data, including features like opening price, closing price, volume, and any relevant external factors. Preprocess the data using the provided scripts or your own data preprocessing methods.

2. **Model Training**: Train the LSTM-based model using the provided notebooks or scripts. Experiment with hyperparameters, model architectures, and feature engineering to optimize performance.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on validation and test datasets using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

4. **Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on future stock prices or to analyze historical data.

## Data

- The dataset contains Microsoft stock prices for the last 23 years.
- You can download the dataset from kaggle.com.

## Model

- This model is the stacked LSTM contains 3 LSTM layers and 1 dense layer.
- Provide details on how to train the model and save it for future use.
